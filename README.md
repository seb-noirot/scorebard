You are working in a sports data company, and we would like you to develop a new Live Football
World Cup Scoreboard library that shows all the ongoing matches and their scores.  
The scoreboard supports the following operations:
1. Start a new match, assuming initial score 0 – 0 and adding it the scoreboard.  
   This should capture following parameters:
   a. Home team
   b. Away team
2. Update score. This should receive a pair of absolute scores: home team score and away
   team score.
3. Finish match currently in progress. This removes a match from the scoreboard.
4. Get a summary of matches in progress ordered by their total score. The matches with the
   same total score will be returned ordered by the most recently started match in the
   scoreboard.
